# Code of Conduct

## Core Ideas

Be respectful, be constructive, be collaborative. We're all here to build useful tools together.

## Guidelines

- **Be respectful** — treat everyone with kindness, even when you disagree. No personal attacks, no trolling.
- **Be constructive** — when reviewing code or discussing ideas, focus on the work, not the person. Offer suggestions, not just criticism.
- **Be collaborative** — ask questions, share knowledge, help others get started. A stronger community benefits everyone.
- **Be professional** — keep discussions focused and on-topic. Don't share others' private information.

## Enforcement

If someone's behavior is making the community worse, reach out to the maintainers in [Telegram](https://t.me/tools_community) or via GitHub. We'll handle it fairly and quickly.
