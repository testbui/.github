# Contributing to Open Builders Tools

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Open Builders! We build open source tools for Telegram communities — access management, giveaways, contests, and more. Every contribution matters, whether it's code, bug reports, documentation, or ideas.

## How We Work

Open Builders tools are built by independent developers supported by $BUILD [grants](https://t.me/builders/264). All tools are open source and run as live products on Telegram: [tools.tg](https://tools.tg).

There are two ways to contribute:

1. **Pick an existing issue** — browse issues labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`, comment that you'd like to work on it, and submit a PR.
2. **Propose something new** — open an issue describing a bug, feature, or improvement. Once approved, you can implement it yourself.

## Getting Started

### 1. Find Something to Work On

- Look for [`good first issue`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOpenBuilders+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aopen&type=issues) labels if you're new
- Look for [`help wanted`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3AOpenBuilders+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+is%3Aopen&type=issues) labels for tasks open to the community
- Issues with the `bounty` label have a $BUILD reward — the amount is described in the issue

### 2. Claim the Issue

Leave a comment on the issue saying you'd like to work on it. A maintainer will assign it to you.

- One assignee per issue at a time
- If there's no visible progress for ~7 days, the issue may be unassigned so others can pick it up
- If you need more time, just communicate — that's totally fine

### 3. Set Up Your Environment

Each tool has its own setup instructions in its `README.md`.

### 4. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Write clear commit messages
- Add tests if applicable
- Update documentation if your change affects it

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Push your branch and open a PR against `main` (or `master`)
- Reference the issue: `Closes #123`
- Fill in the PR template
- Be ready for review feedback — maintainers may request changes

## For Small Fixes

Typos, minor doc improvements, and trivial fixes can be submitted as a PR without a prior issue.

## Opening Issues

### Bug Reports

Use the **Bug Report** template. Include:

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (browser, OS, Telegram version if relevant)
- Screenshots if applicable

### Feature Requests

Use the **Feature Request** template. Describe:

- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternatives you've considered

## Code Review

All PRs are reviewed by maintainers. We aim to respond within 48 hours. Reviews focus on:

- Does the change work as described?
- Is the code clear and maintainable?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Does it follow existing patterns in the codebase?

## Rewards

Some issues carry a `bounty` label with a reward in $BUILD tokens. The reward amount is specified in the issue description and is paid after the PR is merged.
